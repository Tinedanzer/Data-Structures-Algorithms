not going to bother writing code for this... very  simple concepts LIFO /LIFO;

Stacks: LIFO

use an array:            if you dont care about built in methods and only for pop/push at the end;
**use a singly linked:      lists if u need to shift/unshift to activate the 'last' inputted;
doubly linked lists:     if u need to push/pop and shift/unshift

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Queues: FIFO

arrays: heh, dont use  it! cause slow; u know

**singly linked lists:      O(1); best to use;
Terminology: 'inqueue()' and  'dequeue()' are used instead of push() and shift() respectively;

doubly linked lists: just takes up more space; singly is the way to go^

**usually best way to go for stacks/queues.
