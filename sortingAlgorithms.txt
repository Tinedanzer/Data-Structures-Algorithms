These work well with very small arrays:
{
Insertion sort= n^2 most of the time, however it highly excels when data is coming in one at a time and needs to be 'inserted'.

Selection sort= fails nearly all the time in time complexity; o(n^2); must re-sort all data.

Bubble sort= n^2 most of the time, it excels when data is nearly sorted. not as good as insertion sort.
}
