// Graph Notes and Vertex Work
// edge is the connection between two vertices(one-way or two-way)
// Undirected Graph : vertexes are linked to one another(both-way connection) (facebook)
// Directed Graph : vertexes now have a one-way direction, that give the link (twitter)

// Weight Graph: : vertexes now have weight in a certain/or either direction to the next vertex
// think 3d space, linear algebra and difficulty of terrain from one direction to another
// or back the other way downhill.
